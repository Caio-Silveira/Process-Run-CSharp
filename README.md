# Usage Instructions - Process Run CSharp

This repository contains a C# code example that demonstrates how to run external processes using the `Proc` class. The `Proc` class provides a convenient way to execute commands in a new process.

## How to Use the Code

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or another C# development environment.

3. The code includes a class named `Proc` inside the `Example` namespace.

4. The `Proc` class contains a static method named `Init`. This method takes two parameters: `name` (the name of the executable or script to run) and `command` (the command to execute).

5. Inside the `Init` method, a new `Process` object is created and configured with the provided `name` and `command`.

6. The process is started using the `Start` method, and it will execute the specified command.

7. The `CreateNoWindow` property is set to true to prevent the command prompt window from being displayed.

8. The `UseShellExecute` property is set to false to enable the execution of commands directly, without the use of the Windows shell.

9. The process will wait for the command to complete using `WaitForExit`, and then it will terminate.

10. To use the `Proc` class in your project, call the `Init` method and provide the desired `name` and `command` as arguments.

## Important Note

â€¢ Be cautious when running external processes, as they may have security implications. Ensure that you trust the commands and arguments provided to the Proc class to prevent potential security risks.
